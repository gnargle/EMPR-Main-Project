# EMPR-Main-Project

This is a git repository for the University of York CS year 2 EMPR module project. This code is written in C and, using the included makefile, compiles to executable code for the ARM mbed microcontroller. Much of the code can be used with any mbed board, but the LCD and Keypad modules are specific to the breakout IO board created by the UoY CS department.

The aim of this project is to use the mbed to drive a distance-detecting sensor platform. The sensor platform uses a PWM controlled servo motor, and ADC controller IR blaster and receiver, and and ultrasound detector.
